## Background

> - You can use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Aurora, MariaDB, and MySQL.
> - AWS DMS allows you to use SQLite operators and SQLite functions within a transformation rule to compute column values that you can apply to any selected schema, table, or view. In addition, AWS DMS supports expressions, which means using SQLite operators or functions to define the data in a column
